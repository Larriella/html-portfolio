<h1>Top Movies of All Time According to Lara </h1>
<h2>Some of my best 3 Movies for last year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cinderella</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite musical movies. <br />
I like it because it is a modern movie musical with a bold take on classic fairytale<br />
It is one of the movies that i have seen more than two times and I can still watch again <br />
</p>
<h3>Red Notice</h3>
<p>This is an action adventure movie and I love action movies. <br/>
    This movie comes with a twist and cannot be predited. <br/>
    It also funny and I have seen the movie twice and would not mind watching it again. <br/>
</p>
<h3>Purple Hearts</h3>
<p>This movie is a touching movies and full of emotions. <br />
    I enjoyed it but I was in tears because of the emotional part. <br />
    I really like it even though I saw it once. <br />
